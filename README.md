TUTORIAL: 
1- replace the module in your working directory.
2- import the modulle into your script and use it like this:
	
	from cprint import cprint
	cprint("Message to print!")  
								 #at usual u only pass the message and the module chooses automatically									 #random printing style !
								 # but if you want to choose a certian printing style you can pass a 									 #second argument to the cprint()
								 # with the printing sympol for example cprint("Message", "d")   "d" is a 								   #sympol for certain priting style
								 # to know all the printing syles sympoles go read the __init__() function 								    #especially the categories                                        
								 #dictionary cuz all styles is stored there.
